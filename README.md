## **Features**

- Create and edit custom forms
- Add images to questions and a header image
- Preview forms before saving
- Responses are stored in the MongoDB database with proper schemas

2. Install dependencies: **`npm install`**
3. Run backend server: **`npm run server`**
4. Run frontend: **`npm start`**

## ****Inspiration****

The UI design of the form builder takes inspiration from various form builders like Typeform and Paperform while incorporating innovative elements.

I would like to thank BoloForms and Auto Proctor for inspiring this project.
